# companion codebase for "Fundamentals of Java"
* intent of this repo is to draft code that will help understand the chapters and topics from this book by Kenneth Lambert and Martin Osborne
* as you read the book chapter by chapter, use this repo as your sandbox for trying out the concepts presented
* attempt/ try the exercises as well as projects presented in each chapter..
* practise and practise... thats the only way one learns.s

### what this repo provides
* a gradle java application
* use standard project structure
* modularizing packages by four units; each units have chapters and topics
* and we are using GIT for version control

### what you will need
* java 21 or above [openjdk](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/24/).. use LTS versions.. [release matrix](https://www.java.com/releases/matrix/)
* [gradle 9 or above](https://gradle.org/install/).. keep this upgraded.. build automation tool.. professionals use this (others are maven, ant..) [link1](https://www.baeldung.com/ant-maven-gradle); [link2](https://www.jrebel.com/blog/java-build-tools-comparison)
  * Use gradle to learn how to manage code, modularization, dependencies, etc
  * use gradle to compile and build the entire application or project as whole.
  * since High Schools or Middle Schools do not allow installations, and usage of IDEs either... as students you will end up running each java file individually through the IDE
  * its encouraged though to make use of gradle and IDE when you are at Home or an environment which is not having such restrictions
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or similar IDE... productivity booster (others Eclipse, IntelliJ Idea)
* personally my AI assistant is [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com) (previously known as Codeium)... productivity booster

### finally...
* enjoy coding
