    Newtonâ€™s method for computing the square root of a number consists of approximating the
    actual square root by means of a set of transformations. Each transformation starts with a guess
    at the square root. A better approximation is then (guess + number / guess) / 2. This result
    becomes the guess for the next approximation. The initial guess is 1. Write a query-driven pro-
    gram that allows the user to enter a number and the number of approximations to compute its
